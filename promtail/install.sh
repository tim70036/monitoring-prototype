# Letâ€™s reload the systemd, enable then start the service:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start promtail.service
sudo systemctl enable promtail.service
sudo systemctl status promtail.service

# If you want to see log, you can use `journalctl -u promtail.service`

# Note:
# Configure pm2 logrotate to compress rotated log to zip (set compress: true).
# So that promtail will not view rotated log as new log.
